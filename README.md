1. MANDATORY: For first time create new directory named `data` and then add the csv files from the [Elliptic Dataset in Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ellipticco/elliptic-data-set) to it. Then you can run as expected.

2. MANDATORY: View [EDA](https://github.com/FardinAhsan146/Crypto-ML/blob/main/EDA.ipynb). Run data_cleaning.ipynb before running EDA. You don't really need to run it though. Just view it. 

3. View the baseline code/results [here](https://github.com/FardinAhsan146/Crypto-ML/blob/main/src/supervised_baseline.py). 

4. Sampling code/results [here](https://github.com/FardinAhsan146/Crypto-ML/blob/main/src/sampling_test.py).

5. WARNING: Sk-learn source code has been changed [as per](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54267745/implementing-custom-loss-function-in-scikit-learn#58550132). Use a different virtual enviorment.
