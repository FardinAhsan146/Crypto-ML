# Crypto-ML

1. For first time create new directory named `data` and then add the csv files from the [Elliptic Dataset in Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ellipticco/elliptic-data-set) to it. Then you can run as expected.

2. View [EDA](https://github.com/FardinAhsan146/Crypto-ML/blob/main/EDA.ipynb). Run data_cleaning.ipynb before running EDA. You don't really need to run it though. Just view it.
